Microsoft told me there were no plans of a VR windows or plans to support it so begins me open sourcing my baby which is now our baby.  This project is meant to be a 3D Engine for "Virtualizing" files, systems, and games.  It has physics built into it and even allows for the creation of models while in game.  Lets expand our minds and make the future happen here.  One day this may be an all in one 3D-4D operating system without the old 2D boring layouts.
